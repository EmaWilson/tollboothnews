## I Acquired Lip Fillers For The First Time

There is nothing wrong with my lips. They weren't incredibly thin. But nothing beats Kylie Jenner's either. The only way I'd receive lip filler is easily got a gift I couldn't refuse.

And Dr. Melissa Doft, as well respected a plastic surgeon as there can be in NY, did just that.

Free. The task was free of charge. Hashtag unashamed. Here's how it went.

Dr. Doft procedures out from the Upper East Area. I asked her never to do anything also extreme. I had been satisfied with the general shape of my lips.

She told me she would be injecting a hyaluronic acid filler called Restylane Silk. You can grab face moisturizers wealthy with hyaluronic acid at any section store.

What could possibly be wrong with getting a few of that into my lips?

I wasn't worried, provided that it didn't hurt…

Dr. Doft utilized a topical numbing goo. I didn't also feel the excellent needle she pricked my lips with. In that case she dispersed the filler with a syringe.

The process is going on beneath the skin so there's no chance to completely numb that part so there is discomfort. But easily can take it, anyone can.

Most of the filler was applied to my upper lip-while is typical, considering our bottom level lips are usually already plumper than our top ones.

In every, the injection took no longer than 10 minutes. The swelling, though, lasted a little longer.

Dr. Doft described the kind of small swelling I was suffering from was usual and how it wouldn't go longer than three times. All my swelling was eliminated after 48 hours.

For another three weeks, I'd often forget even had the procedure. That's until laid on some lipstick and could really notice an excellent lift up to my lips.

Now another three months have exceeded, and the plump effect has faded somewhat. Three month improvement for 800 dollars? It's noticeable. But you be the judge.

## Bye Bye Dermal Fillers? Botox Lip Flip May Be The New Trend

Botox on the lips? What? That's crazy! If you imagined that fillers happen to be for lips, and Botox is to be utilized on muscles and not used as filler... very well, you'd be right.

The most recent trend in obtaining the pouty lip is Botox, but, no, thankfully it's not being used as filler--and if anyone shows that, you should stay far, far away.

Rather, Botox has been used to augment the lip when you are used around the oral cavity.

### Around the mouth? Why?

It's actually a very simple procedure. The doctor applies Botox to the mouth muscles. This flips the higher lip. And the mouth area comes off fuller.

As the appearance of certain facial features isn't always totally reliant on only the feature itself. Your face is a masterpiece of design -- it truly is. Various areas of it job in conjunction to attain one effect.

It's not only your eye, your lips, as well as your nose. It's your nasolabial folds, the bridge of your nasal area, your cheeks.

Thus, this new style is getting the pout by focusing on everything around the pout.

### Must I do it in this manner?

The procedure is perfectly safe, nonetheless it has its downsides. To begin with, the mouth area muscles... are type of important. If you wish to employ a straw, for example, obtaining a procedure like this might get in the way.

Second, even though both Botox and fillers contain temporary effects, Botox is already an operation that lasts just a little shorter than fillers. And more than that, because you need to apply less Botox so as to retain utilization of the oral cavity muscles, the Botox lasts for possibly less time.

It's not thus much that the task doesn't work around, well, if you would like pouty lips, it may be worth considering just getting pouty lips.
