## 4 New Skin Tightening Treatments That Basically Work

Want to eliminate those sagging jowls? Thus do the rest of us.

But if you're definitely not searching for a face lift, you should know exactly what choices are out there that you should tighten your skin.

Thankfully, a whole selection of innovative and non-invasive remedies exist to assist you with this problem. Here are just a few of them.

### Radiofrequency

Radiofrequency energy that are one of the better options out there.

By heating the collagen beneath the skin, not only does this bring about a tightening and firming effect--it also brings about collagen production.

Radiofrequency can be utilised effectively on both face and the body.

### Ultrasound

Meanwhile, ultrasound remedies like Ultherapy have a similar effect.

Using sound waves instead of radiofrequency, collagen beneath the skin is normally boosted--because ultrasounds can penetrate the skin at different depths.

### Combined microneedling

You will possibly not associate microneedling with skin tightening. And alone, microneedling is extra of a rejuvenation treatment.

But microneedling can be combined effectively with procedures like radiofrequency and laser beam light to have a doubly powerful effect.

Because microneedling really boosts the creation of new collagen, while the radiofrequency causes skin tightening, both work in synergy.

### Spillover skin tightening

Treatments like Kybella and CoolSculpting are actually known mostly for their fat burning effect. But basically, these solutions have a pores and skin tightening effect as well.

Kybella melts fat away with dexoycholic acid even while CoolSculpting freezes it dead: but both these treatments, incidentally, reason your skin to tighten.

Specifically in the chin area. Actually the FDA itself only noted CoolSculpting's submental pores and skin tightening effect.

Overall, patients have a number of choices in terms of tightening their pores and skin -- all with diverse advantages based on their aesthetic goals.
